# Udacity-A-B-Testing
This is the 7th project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the A/B Testing course from Udacity. In this project
we analyzed an experiment similar to one performed at Udacity in which a change in the onboarding process is tested. We choose
and characterize metrics to evaluate the experiment and analyze the results using a variety of statistical techniques to make a
launch recommendation.
